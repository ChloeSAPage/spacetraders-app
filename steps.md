# Steps taken and thought processes

1. Initial Commit and Repo rules

Add rule to Github repo to prevent commits to main and require PR.

2. Read and understand code

Make a request to the register endpoint, store the response and token in state.

3. Change page title

could add a favicon but i cba

4. Move api calls into 1 file

move given anonymous function into a new function called register. Need to return the ok response from fetch, as well as the body.




5. Render information from request

Create new components that are conditionally rendered which contain information needed.

NewGame will be the top level component, I could make app the top level component but I'm unsure if that is correct.


6. Find starting location

I'm thinking this should be a new view, so maybe incorporate react-router.
